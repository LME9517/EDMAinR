The attached data belong to Dr. Neus Martínez-Abadías, whose reasearch is based on the quantification of the phenotypes within people with Down Syndrome and euploid individuals. 
The methodology used is Geometric Morphometrics, that is a methodology that combine concepts of Biology, Geometry and Statistics, and its main concept is "shape" which refers to all the data that remain after the processes of translation, rotation and scaling.
Shape data was obtained using Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) that allowed gather three-dimensional data for reconstructing the human faces of the individual in the sample. After that, the faces were measured placing biomarkers named landmarks that provide 3D coordinate for applying Geometric Morphometrics methods.
File 1: "Euploid_Adults.xyz" (data file containing data for euploid individuals NOT carrying any genetic mutation) K=21 N=160
File 2: "Down-Syndrome_Adults.xyz" (data file containung data for individuals with Down Syndrome) K=21 N=92
These files contain 3D coordinates obtained from landmarks (from the face of the individuals) from the samples above.
