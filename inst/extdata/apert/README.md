# Apert data set

2D landmarks collected from sagittal xrays.  
These data were published in Lele and Richtsmeier 1991.  
They represent landmarks representing a sample of 
typically developing children aged 4 (ALLNORM4) 
and a sample of children with Apert syndrome aged 4 (ALLAPT4).  

## List of landmarks

Figure showing their positioning on an xray is published in
Lele and Richtsmeier 1991.

1. NAS Nasion. Point of intersection of the nasal bones with the frontal bone.
2. NSL Nasale. Inferiormost point of intersection of the nasal bones.
3. ANS Anterior nasal spine. Anteriormost point at the medial intersection of the maxillarybones
at the base of the nasal aperture.
4. IDS Intradentale superior. The point is located on the alveolar border of the maxilla between
the central.
5. PNS Posterior nasal spine. Posteriormost point of intersection of the maxillary bones onthe
hard palate.
6. TSE Tuberculum sella. &quot;Saddle&quot; of bone just posterior to the chiasmatic groove on thebody of
the sphenoid bone.
7. SEL Sella. Most inflexive point of the hypophyseal fossa. The hypophyseal (pituitary)fossa is
defined as the bony depression which holds the pituitary gland. This fossa is bounded by
tuberculum sella anteriorly and posterior sella posteriorly.
8. PSE Posterior sella. A square plate of bone which serves as the posterior border of the
hypophyseal fossa.
9. BAS Basion. The most anterior border of the foramen magnum.
10. IOP Internal occipital protuberance of the cruciate eminence of the occipital bone.
