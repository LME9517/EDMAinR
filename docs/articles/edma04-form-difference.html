<p>Form difference (FDM) is calculated as the ratio of form matrices (FM) from the numerator and denominator objects following Lele and Richtsmeier (1992, 1995): FDM(A,B) = FM(B)/FM(A). Form matrices are formed as pairwise Euclidean distances between landmarks from EDMA fit objects using the estimated mean forms.</p>
<p>Bootstrap distribution is based on fixing the reference FM and taking the ration between the reference FM and the bootstrap FMs from the other object. The <code>ref_denom</code> argument can be used to control which object is the reference:</p>
